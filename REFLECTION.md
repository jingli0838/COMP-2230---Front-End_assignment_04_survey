## Reflection
This project is aiming to create a servey form, with multiple questions.
From this project, I learned how to implement a dropdown menu for a list of choices and get familiar with arrow functions. and alse knew how to calculate age according to the date string from the input. I also learned how to add radio button group for a single-choice question and checkbox group for multiple selections and searched how to use 'checked' to validate radio button and checkbox button.
